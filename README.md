A concert hall has three seating categories: Orchestra, Main floor, and Balcony. Orchestra seats are $25, Main floor seats are $30, and Balcony seats are $15. The manager wants an application that allows him to enter the number of tickets sold in each seating category. The application should calculate the amount of revenue generated by each category, and then display each result using the “N0” format. The application should also calculate the total revenue, displaying the result using the “C0” format.
